# VirtuousAI Full Stack Take Home Exercise Instructions

The goal of this project is to create a web page that dynamically displays a stream of text generated by a POST request to the provided server.

The web page should resemble a chat with an LLM, where users can type in text and submit it. Upon submission, the page should display both the user's text and the stream of text returned by the server.

Once you have started the provided server, a POST to `localhost:8080/stream` will return a stream of JSON objects which have the following schema.

```
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "done": {
      "type": "boolean"
    },
    "text": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": ["done"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

An example message looks like this: `{"text": " eius", "done": false}`

The final message you will receive in the stream will be a JSON object with the following form: `{"done": true}`
